    <h2>Description</h2>
    This crispy fried chicken recipe uses a batter instead of a flour coating. That helps the flour adhere to the chicken so it won’t fall off after cooking! 

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Chicken</strong>: We use the whole bird instead of buying individual chicken pieces. Cutting up a whole chicken creates a nice assortment 
            of white and dark meat while also ensuring all the pieces are cut into even sizes.</li>
        </br><li><strong>The batter</strong>: We tackle the chicken coating in two steps. First, there’s a batter of flour, eggs and water. 
            This evenly coats the chicken and prevents the breading from falling off. Next, we dip the chicken in seasoned flour, which helps the chicken become 
            as crispy as possible when it hits the hot oil.</li>
        </br><li><strong>The seasonings</strong>: We use a flavorful mixture of garlic salt, paprika, black pepper and poultry seasoning. This blend includes dried sage, thyme, rosemary, 
            marjoram and nutmeg. If you don’t have garlic salt on hand, mix your own by combining one part garlic powder with three parts salt (i.e., one teaspoon 
            garlic powder and three teaspoons salt).</li>
        </br><li><strong>Oil</strong>: The best oils for frying are neutral oils, like canola and safflower oil. Their higher smoke points make them ideal for 
            frying chicken and other foods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Dredge the chicken</strong></li>
        In a large shallow dish, combine 2-2/3 cups of the flour with the garlic salt, paprika, 2-1/2 teaspoons of the pepper and the poultry seasoning. 
        In a separate shallow dish, briefly beat the eggs with the water before adding the salt, remaining 1-1/3 cups flour and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
        </br></br>Dip each piece of chicken into the egg mixture and then into the flour mixture. Turn each piece until it is fully coated.
    </br></br><li><strong>Fry the chicken</strong></li>
        Heat the oil to 375°F in an electric skillet or deep-fat fryer. Fry the chicken a few pieces at a time, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. 
        Cook until the chicken is golden brown and the juices run clear, about seven to eight minutes per side. Drain the chicken on a paper towel-lined plate or 
        wire rack.
        </br></br><em>Editor’s Tip</em>: Hold the chicken warm in a 250° oven while you cook the remaining pieces. Keeping the chicken elevated will keep it crispy, so we 
        like to line a baking sheet with an ovenproof cooling rack.
