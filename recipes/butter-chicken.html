 <h2>Description</h2>
 Similar to Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken is one of the most popular curries at any Indian restaurant around the world. Aromatic, golden chicken pieces in an incredible, creamy curry sauce, this Butter Chicken recipe is one of the best you will try! 

 <h3>Ingredients</h3>
 <ul>
     <li><strong>Chicken breast</strong>: You could also use boneless, skinless chicken thighs.</li>
     <li><strong>Lemon juice</strong>: Adds brightness to balance the flavors.</li>
     <li><strong>Garlic</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Garam masala</strong>: A super-flavourful spice blend consisting of up to 10 different Indian spices (including cumin, ground ginger, black pepper, cinnamon, turmeric, cardamom, etc.). Using garam masala saves you buying individual spices you’d need in only small quantities.</li>
    <li><strong>Vegetable oil</strong>: Used for frying the onions, it’s a neutral oil that doesn’t distract from the spices.</li>
    <li><strong>Onion</strong>: Adds sweetness and body to the sauce. Once cooked down, it becomes an imperceptible part of the sauce.</li>
    <li><strong>Paprika</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Cinnamon</strong>: A touch of warmth that complements the other spices beautifully.</li>
    <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Heavy cream</strong>: Also called whipping cream, double cream, thickened cream or 35% m.f. cream depending where you live. Makes the sauce luxuriously creamy and smooth.</li>
    <li><strong>Butter</strong>: Finishes the sauce with a rich, silky texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Cilantro</strong>: A fresh garnish that adds a pop of color and freshness (optional).</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Steps</h3>
 <ol>
 <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken</strong></li>
    Start by prepping your chicken to ensure it absorbs all the wonderful flavors.
     <ul>
        <li>Combine chicken pieces, lemon juice, minced garlic, garam masala, and kosher salt in a zip-top bag or shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Mix well, ensuring each piece is coated. For best results, let the chicken marinate overnight in the fridge; if short on time, 30 minutes at room temperature will work too.</li>
    </ul>
 </br><li><strong>Prepare the Sauce</strong></li>
    A great sauce is the heart of any curry, and this one is no exception.
     <ul>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven.</li>
         <li>Mix well, ensuring each piece is coated. For best results, let the chicken marinate overnight in the fridge; if short on time, 30 minutes at room temperature will work too.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions and cook on medium heat until they are golden brown—this usually takes about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>To the onions, add coarsely chopped garlic and cook for about 1 minute until it’s fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in garam masala, paprika, cinnamon, and kosher salt. Cook for another minute to let the spices bloom.</li>
        <li>Add diced tomatoes and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    </ul>
</br><li><strong>Blend and Simmer</strong></li>
    Blending the sauce helps achieve a smooth, creamy texture that’s perfect for scooping up with naan.
     <ul>
        <li>Once your tomatoes are softened and the spices integrated, add the heavy cream.</li>
        <li>Use an immersion blender to puree the sauce until smooth (if using a standing blender, be cautious of hot steam).</li>
        <li>Return the pureed sauce to the heat and bring it to a gentle simmer.</li>
    </ul>
    </br><li><strong>Cook the Chicken</strong></li>
    Now, it’s time to combine everything and finish cooking.
     <ul>
        <li>Add the marinated chicken to the simmering sauce. Discard any leftover marinade.</li>
        <li>Cover and let it cook on medium-low heat for about 12 minutes. Check a piece to ensure it’s cooked through.</li>
        <li>The chicken should be tender but not overcooked.</li>
    </ul>
        </br><li><strong>Final Touches</strong></li>
        Adding the final ingredients right before serving keeps the flavors fresh and vibrant.
     <ul>
        <li>Stir in the butter until it melts into the sauce.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust salt if needed.</li>
        <li>If using, sprinkle chopped cilantro over the dish as a garnish.</li>
        </br>Serve your Butter Chicken with warm, fluffy naan or rice and enjoy the perfect meal!
