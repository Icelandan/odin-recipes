 <h2>Description</h2>
 Ready in 10 minutes, this vegetarian omelet is perfect for a hearty breakfast, work from home lunch or as part of a shared Thai-style banquet meal.

 <h3>Ingredients</h3>
 <ul>
     <li><strong>Three eggs</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Half a tomato, diced</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Half an onion, diced</strong></li>
     <li><strong>One tablespoon of fish sauce</strong></li>
     <li><strong>One fourth of a teaspoon of white pepper</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Half a cup of vegetable oil</strong></li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Steps</h3>
 <ol>
 <li><strong>Mix the ingredients</strong></li>
    Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add the tomato, onion, fish sauce and white pepper and whisk until just combined.
 </br></br><li><strong>Cook the ingredients</strong></li>
    Add the vegetable oil to a wok or large frying pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, pour in the egg mixture. Use a spatula to splash the oil over the fluffy omelet as it cooks. When golden brown on the bottom, flip the omelet over (you can break it in half and flip it in halves if thatâ€™s easier). Allow to turn golden on the second side. Then remove from heat and transfer to a serving plate.
