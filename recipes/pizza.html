    <h2 class="title">Description</h2>
 <p class="desc">It doesn’t get much more classic than tonight’s veggie pizza. A red sauce made with oregano, garlic, and red onion is a vibrant base for black olives and bell pepper (yours may be green, purple, or even show streaks of red). </p>

 <h3 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h3>
 <ul>
     <li><strong>Pizza Dough</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Tomato sauce</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Garlic</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Bell Pepper</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Dried Oregano</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Red Onion</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Black Cerignola Olives</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Asiago Cheese</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Fontina Cheese</strong></li>
 </ul>

 <h3 class="subtitle">Steps</h3>
 <ol>
 <li><strong>Prepare the ingredients</strong></li>
    Remove the dough from the refrigerator to bring to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 475°F. Fill a large pot with water; add a big pinch of salt and heat to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel and thinly slice the garlic. Peel and thinly slice the onion. Using the flat side of your knife, smash the olives; remove and discard the pits, then roughly chop. Cut off and discard the pepper stem. Halve the pepper lengthwise; remove and discard the ribs and seeds. Thinly slice lengthwise. Grate the asiago and fontina cheeses on the large side of a box grater; combine in a bowl. Grate the Pecorino cheese on the small side of a box grater.
 </br></br><li><strong>Make the sauce</strong></li>
    In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the garlic and onion; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the tomato sauce and oregano; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Turn off the heat. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
 </br></br><li><strong>Assemble & bake the pizza</strong></li>
    Lightly oil a sheet pan. On a work surface, using your hands and a rolling pin (or a wine bottle), gently stretch and roll the dough to a ¼-inch thickness. (If the dough is resistant, let rest for 5 minutes.) Carefully transfer the dough to the prepared sheet pan. Rub the dough into the pan to coat the bottom in oil. Leaving a 1-inch border around the edges, evenly top the prepared dough with the sauce, olives, pepper, and asiago and fontina cheeses. Season with salt and pepper. Bake, rotating the sheet pan halfway through, 16 to 18 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese has melted. Remove from the oven and let stand for at least 2 minutes.
